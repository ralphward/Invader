libgdx stub - can be forked to create new games

This is a fairly basic libgdx project I've started - it will compile to Android, iPhone, Desktop or Web.

It currently has the main things required to start programming a game including an Asset / texture loader, a configurable Menu, an Input System to detect user actions, a parent Actor class and some quick examples of child classes.

It uses a main game loop with a Game State design pattern. This is still very much a Work in progress
